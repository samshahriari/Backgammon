## RULES FOR GIT

#### 1. Branches and branch types

* Master - the main branch
* Feature - branch for new functionality
* Bug - branch for fixes to code bugs

Feature branches are for creating new files and adding new code to existing files. Feature branches are preferably   
limited to as few files as possible so to avoid conflicts when merging with the master branch. Bug branches are for   
fixing issues in files that were not detected when feature branches were merged to master.

#### 2. Branch-naming convention

Branch name should include first three letters of username followed by what type of branch it is followed by a two to   
three-word description of the purpose of the branch.   

Example: `jor-feature-board-class`
